# Linting

We lint everything, including: `javascript`, `vue`, `css`, and `scss`.
We love linting to be as strict as possible.

Everything works for raw files and single file components out of the box.
Everything is already configured, so you don't have to.

Use `yarn lint` to run everything we have.

## javascript

[![JavaScript Style Guide][svg]](https://github.com/standard/standard)

We use `eslint` to lint `javascript`. We stick to `standard` code style.
But, we have some additional checks that make our style even more stricter.

### Configuring eslint

All configuration can be found inside `.eslintrc`.
To run `js` linting execute: `yarn lint:js`.

## flow

`flow` is an optional strict typing.
We use [`eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors) 
to run these checks during linting stage.

You can enable `flow` on a per-file basis. So, it very easy to start.
When file starts with `// @flow` it means that `flow` is enabled. 
Otherwise file is ignored by `flow` checker.

There are two ways to handle `type` imports:

1. Explicitly importing each type when you need it

2. Implicitly including all your types by preloading them 
   from [`[libs]`](https://flow.org/en/docs/config/libs/) 
   section in `.flowconfig`

### vue-flow-typed

We use 3rd party typings for `vue`-related libraries: [`vue-flow-typed`](https://github.com/sobolevn/vue-flow-typed).
You can install and use each package individually depending on what 
packages are you using the most. And what types you need.

### eslint-plugin-flowtype

We also lint `flow` type annotations themselfs. 
We are using [`eslint-plugin-flowtype`][eslint-plugin-flowtype].

## jsdoc

We lint [`jsdoc`](http://usejsdoc.org/) annotation. 
The rule is simple: if you write `jsdoc` you should write a correct one.
You may not write them at all (however, that's not good).

We use [`eslint-plugin-jsdoc`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) 
to lint them.

## Vue

We also lint `.vue` files with the help of [`eslint-plugin-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue).

These checks are executed together with `javascript` linting.

## Styles

We use awesome [`stylelint`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) 
to validate our `css` and `scss` files.
We also use strict config here. 
We stick to [`stylelint-config-strict-scss`](https://github.com/wemake-services/stylelint-config-strict-scss).

`stylelint` is not related with `eslint` at all. It is a standalone tool.
Other plugins for languages like `stylus`, `sass`, 
and `post-css` can also be installed if you need them.

To run `css` linting execute: `yarn lint:css`.

### Configuring stylelint

All configuration is done [inside `package.json`](configuration.md#stylelint). 
Since configuration is rather simple.

If your configuration requires some complex logic, 
consider moving to [`stylelint.config.js`][stylelint.config.js]

## Afterwords

Linting can be easily changed to any other styles you like (or forced to use).
