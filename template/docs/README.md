# Welcome to {{ name }} documentation

It is separated in three main parts:

1. `template/` folder, which contains documentation about [`wemake-vue-template`](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-vue-template). This folder should be in sync with the latest version in the upstream. You do not need to modify it on most of the times
2. `project/` folder, contains documentation specific to your project. Feel free to add anything into it
3. `documents/` folder contains binary files, such as: images, word documents, and spreadsheets


## Where to go next

You can jump start reading this docs from the `template/` part.
